# hyrax-bls12-381

## Introduction
This is a polynomial commitment implementation refer to [Hyrax](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1132.pdf) based on BLS12-381 implemented by [mcl](https://github.com/herumi/mcl). The underline operations of scalar and group element refers to OpenSSL.
This scheme is particularly for multi-linear extension of an array.
